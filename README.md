# Runway-Lights
Displays a 3-LED FSM to animate runway hazard lights. Uses a clock divider, tests it thoroughly in ModelSim, and implements it on an FPGA. The lights cycle is based on the wind direction indicated by two switches. Provides a reset function using KEY[0], and is optimized for minimal logic usage.
